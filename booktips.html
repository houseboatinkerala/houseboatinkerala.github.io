				Advise for booking a houseboat in Alleppey, Kerala
			</h3>
			<div>
				Lagoonbliss.com would like to give you some tips before booking a houseboat cruise or night stay in any houseboats in Kerala backwaters
			</div>
			<ul class="booking-tips">
				<li>
					Bypass the middlemen -- The very basic fact as in any trade is that when you skip the intermediate people you can avail the best rates and assure the finest quality, which is apt for reserving a houseboat as well. So try contact the houseboat owner directly than booking via a third party
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure you are seeing the right pictures -- You would have been presented with a nice picture of a houseboat while booking it and later when you actually about to board the boat you might found yourself cheated by the agent. Not to forget that if there was any technical issue with the boat house you booked then you have the right to get an equivalent boat or concession in the price if they fail to get you a better one.
				</li>

				<li>
					Book the whole boat -- It is the most enchanting experience of you vacation and you dont want to ruin the peace and happiness by sharing the boat with some boring or harsh co-travellers. I bet you, the extra cost you have to pay is very minimal compared to the privacy you trade, otherwise.
				</li>


				<li>
					An a/c boat house -- It is true that god has shown all of his talent in crafting the beautiful landscape of Kerala, but the tourists from the northern part of the globe may find it a little uncomfortable during the peak summer season. Though cool breeze blowing gently of the scenic backwaters of Kerala, itself serves as the natural air conditioner, you may opt for a full time ac houseboat cruise.
				</li>


				<li>
					Food, the good part -- Many of the travellers forget to keep an eye on the gently passing greens besides them as they are too busy tasting the yummy ethnic dishes offered on board, of course if you have chosen the right house boat. If you are to choosy about the diet, then prior to making the deal ensure that the boat crew is experienced in preparing continental, Chinese cuisines etc. as per your choice.
				</li>


				<li>
					Hear from the experienced --  As internet has the vital role nowadays, smart houseboat owner serve their guest at their best and listen to them if there arises any complaints and address them and in turn keep their goodwill in internet space. Always go through the review comments by previous travellers of the houseboat you are about to book, in different websites. As social media gives more vivid picture on these definitely go through the houseboat review in Facebook page and Google+, than not only going through the travel review sites.
				</li>


				<li>
					Double deck or sun deck -- Double deck offers you more privacy and wider view of the lagoons, but it cost only a little higher price compared to your entire expense. If you are going for a single deck houseboat then it is advisable to reserve a house boat with a sun deck
				</li>
			</ul>
